.About the license and Creative Commons
****
Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and does
not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons
public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative
Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an "as-is"
basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any

Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use

.Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
****
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

.Considerations for licensors
******
Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public
permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and
certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying
it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our
licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors
should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes
other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation
to copyright.

.Considerations for the public
******
By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason-for example, because of
any applicable exception or limitation to copyright-then that use is not
regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright
and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the
licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because
others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those
requests where reasonable.

== CC0 1.0 Universal

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.

=== Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

=== 1. Copyright and Related Rights.

A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or
neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related
Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

[lowerroman]
. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and
  translate a Work;
. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;
. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to
  the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
  Work;
. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based
  on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

=== 2. Waiver.

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable
law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

=== 3. Public License Fallback.

Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the
maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of
Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby
grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including
without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

=== 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

[loweralpha]
. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
  any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
  defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
  may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
  person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
  other rights required for any use of the Work.
. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to
  this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use
  of the Work.
